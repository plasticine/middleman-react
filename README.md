===============

### Use [React] JSX transformations with [Middleman].

Inspired (and pretty much a clone of really) the [react-rails] gem for Middleman. This gem allows you to write and use `*.jsx` assets inside Middleman.

#### Usage
1. `gem install middleman-react`
2. `activate :react` in `config.rb`

##### Options

It is also possible to pass options through to the JSX compiler if thatâ€™s your thing:

``` ruby
activate :react do |config|
  config.harmony = true
  config.strip_types = true
end
```

#### Sprockets loading react-source

In your Middleman `config.rb` add the following:

``` ruby
after_configuration do
  sprockets.append_path File.dirname(::React::Source.bundled_path_for('react.js'))
end
```

Now you can Sprockets include React:

```
//= require react
```

Or with addons:

```
//= require react-with-addons
```


#### React Helper & Server Rendering

`react_component` is a helper that will let you pass in data from ruby code and have it rendered via React.  This rendering can be done on the client (default), or on the server, which is handy for SEO.

```
<%= react_component "Book", {data: book } %>
```

For server prerendering you need to include the `react_ujs` javascript component to wire up the prendered content.  So:

```
<%= react_component "Book", {data: book }, {prerender: true} %>
```

In your main `.js` file:

```
//= require react_ujs
```

And in `config.rb`:

```
after_configuration do
  sprockets.append_path File.dirname(Middleman::React::react_ujs_path)
end
```


#### A note on versioning

The version for this gem will reflect that of the underlying version of `react-source`, meaning that using `0.12.1` of this gem will give you version `0.12.1` of React. This is the same approach that `react-rails` takes.
If updates to the gem code are required that do not alter the `react-source` version in use need to be made they will be released with a `.x` version appended, eg: `0.12.1.x`.
